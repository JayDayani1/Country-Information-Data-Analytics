# Country-Information-Data-Analytics
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for analyzing country information data. The project focuses on data cleaning, handling missing values, and performing normality tests on numerical columns.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze country information data to identify trends, handle missing values, and perform statistical tests to ensure data normality. The key tasks include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Checking for missing values and understanding the data structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring the dataset is complete.
3. **Normality Tests**: Performing statistical tests on numerical columns to check for normality.

## File Description

- **Country Information Data Analytics.ipynb**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code, visualizations, and explanations for the project tasks.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `jupyter`

The dataset was analyzed to check for missing values, which were found in the Age and Income columns. These missing values were handled using appropriate data cleaning techniques. Normality tests were performed on the numerical columns to ensure the data follows a normal distribution, which is crucial for further statistical analysis.
